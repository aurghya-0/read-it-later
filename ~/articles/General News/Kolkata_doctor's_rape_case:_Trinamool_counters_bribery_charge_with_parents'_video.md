## Summary

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has responded to allegations of bribery involving the Kolkata Police in the case of a trainee doctor who was allegedly raped and murdered. During a press conference, TMC leader Shashi Panja accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of politicizing the tragedy that occurred on August 9, 2024. 

To counter claims made by the parents of the victim, which suggested that a senior police official had offered them money for the return of their daughter's body, the TMC released a video. This video featured the victim's father denying the bribery allegations, labeling them as baseless and asserting that they are seeking justice for their daughter rather than engaging in political disputes.

The TMC criticized the BJP for allegedly exploiting the situation for political gains, stating that the victim's family should not be dragged into such matters, and pointed out that the family had not been allowed to see their daughter's body before the post-mortem. The tragic incident has led to nationwide protests and a strike by junior doctors in West Bengal, highlighting the public's outcry for justice in this sensitive matter.
